Each brand is talked about in countless ways, across numerous videos. Figuring out what the majority feels or spotting emerging trends requires understanding and analyzing a massive amount of text. People express themselves in very different ways. They use language that's rich, nuanced, and sometimes ambiguous. Automated tools can help, but they're not perfect. They need to be smart enough to catch sarcasm, praise, complaints, and everything in between. For this project I am limiting the scope of the work to tech products launched by Apple. I will keep Apple at the center and compare their product across different categories with their competitors in the said category to understand how their customers view them as a brand.
